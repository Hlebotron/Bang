HOW TO MAKE EXECUTABLE<br>
	Step 1: Install cargo - This is the package manager of Rust, but this can also be used to compile larger programs. To install it, use the package manager of your choice with the package name "rust" or "cargo", but chances are, it's already included in the OS you're using.
  Step 2: Compile the program - Go to the directory of the downloaded repository and then use "cargo run"<br>
  Step 3: Enjoy!
